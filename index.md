### Welcome to my Pages
Hi,I am Felix.A student in BIT majoring in data science and big data technology.


### About me:music and computer science
I love music,especially punk/rock/Rythm and blues/classic music.
I have my own rock band for 8 years working as vocal and guitarist and lead singer.
I've spent 10 years roughly to practice many kinds of instruments such as guitar,piano,cello,bass,drum,harmonica and so on.
Now I am familiar with the whole process of making a song:writer the word/melody,arrangement,recording,mix,mastering.
And I have published severl my own songs too and become a contracted musician of net music company.

I also have a keen interest in programming.
But it seems that I begin too late.
When I was in high school I begin to learn something about python and c language.
I will try to learn more in the future.

I'm interested in the brand new majority:Computer music(music technology),which combines music knowledge and computer knowledge.
Computer music production mainly takes computer as the control center, MIDI technology and digital audio technology as the control means and information exchange language, synthesizer and sampler, etc.Many overseas university have set this course such as Carnegie Mellon University and Stanford University.
I am trying to learn more about music and computer and read some papers in this field and I hope I can do a job relating to it.
